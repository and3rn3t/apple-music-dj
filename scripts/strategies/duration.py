"""Fit a finished playlist to a running time (`--minutes`), keeping its order.

Every strategy hands back its tracks already in their final order (an energy arc, or
constellation's familiar-to-frontier gradient). Dropping tracks from such a list leaves a
subsequence, which keeps the shape: an ascending workout still ascends, a wave still peaks
in the middle. So fitting is only a question of *which* tracks to drop.
