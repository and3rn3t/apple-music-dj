  Your AI Apple Music curator. Builds playlists from your real listening history, finds songs
  like any artist or song, makes decade throwbacks and two-person blends, shows how your taste
  changes over time, and rebuilds playlists from a Spotify export or text list. Anything that
  changes your account is opt-in and confirmed first, and a built-in demo lets you try it with no
  tokens. Also covers mood and activity playlists,
  deep cuts, trending picks, taste DNA cards, compatibility scores, listening insights and year
  in review, catalog gap analysis, album deep dives, artist rabbit holes, daily song drops,
  concert prep, a new release radar, and scheduled weekly curation via cron. Use whenever the
  user mentions Apple Music, playlists, music recommendations, listening habits, music taste,
  "what should I listen to", discovering new music, mood or workout playlists, deep cuts, hidden
  gems, trending music, "surprise me", refreshing a playlist, or anything related to curating
  their music experience. Also trigger on: "DJ", "mix", "playlist for", "music for", "songs
  like", "similar to", "more like", "what's hot", "new releases for me", "taste DNA", "taste
  card", "compatibility", "how compatible", "year in review", "listening stats", "what have I
  missed", "album deep dive", "rabbit hole", "concert prep", "seeing [artist] live", "daily
  song", "what should I listen to right now", "blend", "throwback", "[decade] playlist", "taste
  drift", "how has my taste changed", "import my playlist", "I didn't like track", "add the
  missing albums", "set up Apple Music tokens", "try the demo", or OpenClaw in the context of music.

# Apple Music DJ 🎧

An intelligent Apple Music personalization engine for OpenClaw. Reads your listening history,
Replay stats, ratings, and library to build a deep taste profile — then generates playlists
using eight strategies, surfaces insights about your listening, and creates the playlists you
ask for in your own Apple Music library. Also includes shareable Taste DNA Cards, compatibility
scoring, catalog gap analysis, album deep dives, artist rabbit holes, daily song drops, concert
prep playlists, and personalized new release radar.

## At a glance

**What it does:** reads your Apple Music listening (recently played, heavy rotation, library,
ratings, Replay), builds a taste profile, and turns it into playlists and insights.

**Try saying**

| You say | You get |
|---|---|
| "Analyze my taste" | A Taste DNA profile and a shareable card |
| "Songs like Phoebe Bridgers" | A playlist of similar artists, filtered through your taste |
| "Make me a 90s throwback" | A decade playlist built from your own artists |
| "Blend my taste with my sister's" | One playlist for two listeners |
| "How has my taste changed since spring?" | A drift report from your saved snapshots |
| "Import this Spotify playlist" | A matched Apple Music playlist (preview first) |
| "I didn't like track 7" | Rated down and kept out of future playlists |

**What it needs:** for your own music, an Apple Developer account (for a MusicKit token) and an
Apple Music subscription. The skill loads without tokens so it can offer the demo first. `scripts/setup_auth.py` gets both tokens in one step (sign in with Apple in the
browser). Tokens live in environment variables.

**No account yet?** `python3 scripts/demo.py tour` runs the real scripts against a fictional
listener and a local sample catalog — no tokens, nothing sent to Apple, nothing written to an account.

**Safety:** read-only by default. Creating playlists, favoriting, rating, adding albums and
scheduling cron jobs are opt-in and confirmed first (the scripts preview by default and write only
with an explicit `--create` / `--yes` / `--apply` / `--confirm`). **Editing an existing playlist can
remove tracks** (`playlist_health.py fix --apply` removes duplicate copies and adds a replacement for each unavailable track (it leaves the unavailable entry in place);
`build_playlist.sh refresh|remove` add or remove tracks) — show the exact changes and get a yes first.
Scheduled jobs run unattended once installed, so installing one needs a reviewed `--confirm` digest.
Local data is owner-only (`~/.apple-music-dj/`). See `SECURITY.md`.

## Prerequisites

Two environment variables are needed for anything that reads or changes the user's Apple Music:
`APPLE_MUSIC_DEV_TOKEN` and `APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN`. They are declared as optional (`envVars`,
`required: false`) rather than in `requires.env`, so OpenClaw still loads this skill for someone
who hasn't set them up yet; this section is how you handle that. Every script that talks to
Apple checks for them at run time and stops with a pointer to `setup_auth.py`. If they're missing:

1. **Offer the demo first** so the user sees what they'd get: run `python3 scripts/demo.py tour`
   and show the output. It needs no tokens, uses a fictional listener and a local sample catalog,
   and never touches an account. Say clearly that the demo results aren't theirs. Any other
   request can be shown in demo mode too: `python3 scripts/demo.py run <script> [args]`, with
   `DEMO_PROFILE` standing in for the profile path (e.g. `demo.py run strategy_engine.py --strategy
   mood --mood focus --profile DEMO_PROFILE`). Never present a demo playlist as created in their library.
2. **Then set up real tokens**: ask the user to run `python3 scripts/setup_auth.py` **in their own
   terminal**. It signs the developer token from their MusicKit key, opens a local page where
   they sign in with Apple, and prints the `export` lines (or `--env-file PATH` writes them to an
   owner-only file). Don't run it yourself or ask them to paste tokens into the chat. Full manual
   steps: `references/auth-setup.md`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_MUSIC_DEV_TOKEN` | JWT signed with MusicKit private key (Apple Developer portal) |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN` | Per-user authorization token (obtained via MusicKit JS `authorize()`) |

Verify with: `scripts/apple_music_api.sh verify` (or the fuller `scripts/verify_setup.sh`).
`python3 scripts/setup_auth.py status` shows how long each token has left; the profiler and
`verify_setup.sh` warn when the developer token is within 14 days of expiry or the user token is
nearing the ~6 months these usually last.

## Taste Profiling

Before generating any playlist, build (or load from cache) a taste profile.

Run: `python3 scripts/taste_profiler.py [--cache ~/.apple-music-dj/taste_profile.json] [--max-age 0] [--storefront us]`

Use `--max-age 0` to force a refresh, bypassing any cached profile.

The profiler pulls from **all available data sources**:

| Source | Endpoint | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Loved/disliked songs | `GET /v1/me/ratings/songs` | ★★★★★ Explicit intent |
| Heavy rotation | `GET /v1/me/history/heavy-rotation` | ★★★★☆ Repeated engagement |
| Recently played | `GET /v1/me/recent/played/tracks` | ★★★★☆ Current mood |
| Replay summaries | `GET /v1/me/music-summaries` | ★★★★☆ Annual deep data |
| Library songs | `GET /v1/me/library/songs?include=catalog` | ★★★☆☆ Broad taste |
| Library artists | `GET /v1/me/library/artists` | ★★★☆☆ Artist affinity |
| Recommendations | `GET /v1/me/recommendations` | ★★☆☆☆ Apple's inference |

**Output:** Taste DNA profile cached at `~/.apple-music-dj/taste_profile.json` (7-day TTL by default).

The profile includes: top artists (weighted), genre distribution, era profile, energy
classification, variety score, loved/disliked IDs, library song IDs, and Replay highlights.

### Sparse Data Handling

If the user has limited history:
1. Check Replay data — covers a full year even if recent history is short
2. Lean on `/me/recommendations`
3. Ask user to name 3–5 artists/songs they love as manual seeds
4. Use catalog search with those seeds to bootstrap

## Playlist Strategies

Eight strategies. Read detailed algorithms in `references/playlist-strategies.md`.

### Strategy 1: Deep Cuts Explorer
**Triggers:** "deep cuts", "hidden gems", "B-sides", "underrated", "album tracks"
Find tracks from artists the user loves but hasn't heard yet. Excludes top songs, singles,
and anything in library.

### Strategy 2: Mood / Activity Matcher
**Triggers:** "workout", "chill", "focus", "party", "sleep", "cooking", "driving",
"running", "morning", "sad", "study", "dinner" — any mood/activity word.
Maps mood to musical attributes, filters through user's taste.

### Strategy 3: Trend Radar
**Triggers:** "trending", "what's hot", "charts", "popular", "new releases"
Current charts filtered through user's genre preferences. Includes wildcard picks.

### Strategy 4: Constellation Discovery
**Triggers:** "surprise me", "something new", "expand my taste", "I'm bored", "discovery"
Journey from familiar artists outward to new territory in 3 "rings" of distance.

### Strategy 5: Playlist Refresh / Evolution
**Triggers:** "refresh my [playlist]", "update my [playlist]", "evolve", "getting stale"
Analyzes existing playlist's sonic signature, adds fresh matching tracks, optionally
prunes overplayed songs. Changing the original playlist adds or removes tracks, so show the
proposed additions and removals and only apply them after a yes.

### Strategy 6: Similar ("songs like X")
**Triggers:** "songs like [artist/song]", "more like [artist]", "similar to", "more like track 3"
Starts from one artist or song, pulls in its top songs plus similar artists' top songs, and
scores everything against both the starting point's genres and the user's taste.

Run: `python3 scripts/strategy_engine.py --strategy similar --similar-to "Radiohead" --profile <profile.json> --storefront <sf>`
Add `--similar-type artist|song` if the name is ambiguous (default detects it).
For "more like track N" of a DJ playlist, get the song first:
`python3 scripts/feedback.py info --playlist-name "<name>" --position N`, then pass
`--similar-to "<name> <artist>" --similar-type song`.

### Strategy 7: Era Throwback
**Triggers:** "90s playlist", "throwback", "[decade] throwback", "music from the 2000s"
A decade playlist built from the user's own artists and genres, not a generic nostalgia list.

Run: `python3 scripts/strategy_engine.py --strategy era --decade 90s --profile <profile.json> --storefront <sf>`
Without `--decade` it uses the user's top era.

### Strategy 8: Blend
**Triggers:** "blend", "playlist for me and [person]", "something we'd both like", "road trip with my partner"
One playlist for two listeners: artists they share, plus each person's favorites that fit the
other's genres. Neither listener supplies more than 60% of the tracks. The output includes
their compatibility score.

The other person builds their own profile with their own tokens
(`python3 scripts/taste_profiler.py --output friend.json`) and shares the JSON file.
Run: `python3 scripts/strategy_engine.py --strategy blend --profile <mine.json> --profile-b <friend.json> --storefront <sf>`

### Options shared by all strategies
- `--include-library` — allow songs already in the library (refresh, similar and era skip them by default)
- `--create` — create the playlist in Apple Music (without it, only JSON is printed)
- `--favorite` — with `--create`, also add every track to the user's Apple Music favorites.
  **This writes to the user's account — confirm with them first.**

Energy arcs: playlists are sequenced by an energy arc — a wave (medium opener → peak in the middle →
wind-down) by default, rising for workout/anger moods, falling for sleep/focus/sad. Tempo-ordered
playlists also transition more smoothly with Apple Music's AutoMix, which is worth mentioning.

## Engagement Features

Beyond playlist strategies, these features drive daily engagement and deeper music discovery.

### Taste DNA Card
**Triggers:** "taste card", "taste DNA", "share my taste", "my music identity", "listener profile"
Generate a shareable visual card (SVG or text) summarizing the user's taste: archetype label
(e.g., "Deep Catalog Digger", "Genre Drifter"), top genres with bars, top artists, era mix,
and stats (energy, variety, mainstream, velocity).

Run: `python3 scripts/taste_card.py <profile.json> [--format svg|text] [--output card.svg]`

Archetype detection is automatic based on profile data. Always present the text version
in chat; offer to generate the SVG for sharing. The card is designed to be screenshot-friendly.

### Compatibility Score
**Triggers:** "how compatible am I with [artist]", "compatibility", "do I match [artist]",
"compare my taste with", "would I like [artist]"
Score how well the user's taste aligns with an artist's catalog DNA (0-100%).
Also supports comparing two user profiles if both have run the taste profiler.

Run:
- `python3 scripts/compatibility.py artist <profile.json> <storefront> <artist_name>`
- `python3 scripts/compatibility.py profile <profile1.json> <profile2.json>`

Present the percentage, a verdict ("Deeply compatible", "Strong overlap", "Wild card"),
matching genres, and whether the artist is already in their library.

### Listening Insights
**Triggers:** "listening timeline", "how has my taste changed", "listening streaks",
"milestones", "year in review", "my [year] in music", "wrapped", "listening stats"

Three subcommands:

**Timeline:** `python3 scripts/listening_insights.py timeline <profile.json>`
Shows taste evolution across Replay years — top artist, genre, and listen time per year.
Present as a narrative: "In 2022 you were deep into shoegaze, by 2024 you shifted to jazz."

**Streaks:** `python3 scripts/listening_insights.py streaks <profile.json>`
Surfaces milestones (from Replay API) and computed insights: artist loyalty, genre dominance,
discovery rate, library size, rating activity.

**Year in Review:** `python3 scripts/listening_insights.py year-review <profile.json> [--year 2025]`
Comprehensive year analysis — deeper than Apple Replay. Includes obscurity score, variety
analysis, top songs/artists/albums, total listen time, and narrative insights.

### Catalog Gap Analysis
**Triggers:** "what have I missed", "what am I missing from [artist]", "catalog gaps",
"albums I haven't heard", "discography check"
Scans the user's favorite artists' full discographies and identifies albums with zero tracks
in the user's library. Ranks recommendations by release date.

Run: `python3 scripts/catalog_explorer.py gap-analysis <profile.json> <storefront>`

Present as: "You love Radiohead but you've only heard 3 of their 9 albums. Here's what
you're missing, ranked by how much you'd probably like each one."

**Add them to the library:** `... gap-analysis <profile.json> <storefront> --add-missing 5`
previews the newest 5 missing albums and changes nothing. **Adding writes to the user's
library — show them the preview and get a yes before re-running with `--yes`.**

### Taste Drift
**Triggers:** "taste drift", "how has my taste changed lately", "what's changed since [date]",
"am I listening to different stuff", "what's new in my taste"
Every fresh `taste_profiler.py` build saves a small dated snapshot (no song IDs) to
`~/.apple-music-dj/snapshots/`. Drift compares the newest one with the snapshot closest to
the chosen date: genres rising and falling, artists entering or leaving the top 20, era shift,
variety/mainstream/energy changes, and whether the listener archetype changed.

Run: `python3 scripts/taste_drift.py [--since 90d | --from 2026-01-01] [--profile <profile.json>] --format text`
Needs at least two snapshots from different days. If there are fewer, say so and suggest
setting up the monthly drift job (below); use Listening Insights → Timeline for long-range history from Replay.
Card: `python3 scripts/taste_drift.py > drift.json` then
`python3 scripts/taste_card.py <profile.json> --mode drift --data drift.json [--format text]`.

### Import a Playlist
**Triggers:** "import my Spotify playlist", "move this playlist to Apple Music", "rebuild this list in Apple Music"
Rebuilds a playlist from a CSV (e.g. a Spotify export from a tool like Exportify) or a text file of
`Artist - Title` lines. Matches by ISRC when the CSV has that column, otherwise by a strict title +
artist search; anything unclear is reported as unmatched instead of guessed. The user's steps for
getting a playlist out of Spotify are in `references/spotify-import.md`.

Preview: `python3 scripts/import_playlist.py <file>`
Create: `python3 scripts/import_playlist.py <file> --create --name "<name>"` (writes to the library — confirm first)
Show the user the exact / fuzzy / unmatched counts and list the unmatched ones.

### Feedback
**Triggers:** "I didn't like track 7", "thumbs down that song", "I loved track 3", "never play that again"
Rates the song in Apple Music and updates the cached profile so later playlists skip it
immediately: `python3 scripts/feedback.py dislike --playlist-name "<name>" --position 7 --profile <profile.json>`
(or pass song IDs; `like` and `clear` also exist). Without `--yes` it only previews; add `--yes` once the user has confirmed. Positions are 1-based within playlists the DJ
created; omit `--playlist-name` for the most recent one. **This writes a rating to the user's account**,
so only do it on the user's explicit say-so, and name the song and the rating you are about to write
when it isn't obvious which track they mean.

### Album Deep Dive
**Triggers:** "tell me about [album]", "album deep dive", "what's on [album]",
"should I listen to [album]", "break down [album]"
Pull track listing, classify each track as single vs deep cut, show where the album sits
in the artist's discography, and recommend which deep cuts to try first.

Run: `python3 scripts/catalog_explorer.py album-dive <storefront> <album_name> [--artist <name>]`

### Artist Rabbit Hole
**Triggers:** "rabbit hole from [artist]", "take me on a journey from [artist]",
"artist chain", "explore from [artist]", "where does [artist] lead"
Interactive chain exploration. Starts from one artist, searches for adjacent artists,
maps outward step by step. Each step tagged as familiar/adjacent/frontier zone.
Outputs tracks from each artist for a potential journey playlist.

Run: `python3 scripts/catalog_explorer.py rabbit-hole <profile.json> <storefront> <artist_name> [--depth 4]`

Present each step with the artist name, zone, genres, and sample tracks. Ask if the user
wants to go deeper or turn the exploration into a playlist.

### Daily Song Drop
**Triggers:** "daily song", "song of the day", "give me one track", "daily pick"
One track per day with a one-sentence rationale. Uses a date-based seed for consistency
(same pick all day). Draws from deep cuts and trending tracks scored against the user's taste.

Run: `python3 scripts/daily_pick.py daily <profile.json> <storefront>`

### What Should I Listen To Right Now?
**Triggers:** "what should I listen to", "what should I play", "recommend something now",
"I need music", "play something"
Context-aware instant recommendation. Factors in time of day (morning → gentle indie,
late night → ambient), maps to genre boosts, and scores candidates accordingly.

Run: `python3 scripts/daily_pick.py now <profile.json> <storefront>`

### Concert Prep Playlist
**Triggers:** "seeing [artist] live", "concert prep", "going to [artist] show",
"setlist for [artist]", "get ready for [artist] concert"
Builds a prep playlist: top songs (likely setlist material) + deep cuts to learn before
the show. **Preview first:** by default the script writes nothing to Apple Music — it prints the
proposed name, description and track list as JSON. Show that to the user and, only after they
say yes, re-run the same command with `--create`. If the preview shows `"name_exists": true`, a
playlist with that name is already in the library and creation would be skipped — pick another name.

Run: `scripts/concert_prep.sh <storefront> <artist_name> [playlist_name] [--create]`

### Personalized New Release Radar
**Triggers:** "new releases", "what's new from my artists", "any new music",
"release radar", "new albums this week"
Scans the user's top 20 artists for releases in the last 7 days, plus searches for
genre-relevant new releases from adjacent artists. Can optionally create a playlist.

Run: `scripts/new_releases.sh <profile.json> <storefront> [--create-playlist]`

## Cron / Automated Playlists

OpenClaw has first-class cron and heartbeat support. This skill can automate the jobs below.
Unlike interactive requests, **a scheduled job runs unattended and writes on its own** if it is a
writing job. By default `setup_cron.py install` only schedules the report-only jobs (new releases,
daily drop, health check). The **weekly mix creates a playlist in the library without asking**, so it is opt-in: it is installed only when named
(`--jobs weekly-mix`). Installing any job is the user's approval, which is why `install` needs a
reviewed `--confirm` digest — say so when setting one up, and tell the user plainly that the weekly
mix will create playlists without asking each time.

**Weekly Mix** (opt-in — install with `setup_cron.py install --jobs weekly-mix`):
```
Schedule: Every Sunday at 9:00 AM (user's local time)
Task:
  1. Refresh taste profile cache
  2. Run Trend Radar (15 tracks)
  3. Run Constellation Discovery (10 tracks)
  4. Merge into "Weekly Mix · {date}" playlist
  5. Create in library
  6. Notify user: "🎧 Your weekly mix is ready — 25 fresh tracks"
```

**New Release Watch:**
```
Schedule: Daily at 8:00 AM
Task:
  1. scripts/new_releases.sh <profile> <storefront>
  2. If found: notify user with artist + album/single name
  3. Only if the user asked for scheduled playlist creation: add --create-playlist (the
     built-in `new-releases` job reports only and never writes)
```

**Daily Song Drop:**
```
Schedule: Daily at 9:00 AM
Task:
  1. python3 scripts/daily_pick.py daily <profile> <storefront>
  2. Notify user: "🎧 Today's pick: {song} by {artist} — {reason}"
```

**Playlist Health Check:**
```
Schedule: Weekly (Saturday)
Task:
  1. Scan user's playlists
  2. Flag any tracks removed from Apple Music catalog (404 on lookup)
  3. Suggest replacements (report only: the scheduled job runs `playlist_health.py check`;
     removing duplicate copies or adding replacement tracks needs
     `playlist_health.py fix <id> --apply`, which previews by default and is never run unattended)
```

**Monthly Drift** (opt-in — install with `setup_cron.py install --jobs monthly-drift`):
```
Schedule: 2nd of each month at 9:00 AM
Task:
  1. Rebuild the taste profile (saves a dated snapshot)
  2. python3 scripts/taste_drift.py --profile <profile> --since 30d --format text
  3. Notify user with the one-line summary
```

When the user asks to set up automation, configure via OpenClaw's cron system and
confirm the schedule with them before activating. A crontab entry keeps running until removed,
so **always run `python3 scripts/setup_cron.py install --dry-run [--jobs ...]` first and show the
user the exact lines it prints, along with its `Digest:`; only after they say yes, run the same
command with `--confirm <digest>`.** This is enforced in code: `install` without a matching
`--confirm` changes nothing and exits 2, and a digest only matches the exact lines it was printed
for (change a job, path or storefront and it no longer matches). The installer also validates its
arguments, quotes every value, and creates owner-only log files. `setup_cron.py status` / `remove`
let the user review or undo it.

## Assembly Rules

After any strategy produces candidate tracks, apply before creating:

**Sequencing:**
1. Tracks 1–3: Open strong (high-confidence picks)
2. Tracks 4–8: Build energy, introduce variety
3. Tracks 9–15: Peak — best discoveries here
4. Tracks 16–22: Sustain interest, new textures
5. Tracks 23–28: Wind down
6. Final track: Memorable closer, not filler

The strategy engine applies this arc automatically: each track gets an `energy` value (0–1)
from its genres, and `sequence_tracks` orders by a wave, rising or falling arc before enforcing
the spacing rules below.

**Hard rules:**
- Min 5 tracks between same-artist repeats
- Max 2 tracks from same album
- No tracks from disliked artists
- No explicit content unless user's library already has it
- All IDs must be catalog IDs (not library IDs)
- Target: 25–40 tracks unless user specifies otherwise

**Naming:** `{Strategy} · {Context} · {Mon YYYY}`

## Storefront Detection

Catalog endpoints need a storefront code (us, gb, jp...).
Detection order:
1. `APPLE_MUSIC_STOREFRONT` env var → use it
2. `GET /v1/me/storefront` → auto-detect and cache
3. Fall back to `us`, warn user

## Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | Dev token invalid/expired | Ask the user to run `python3 scripts/setup_auth.py --new-dev-token` |
| 403 | User token expired (~6mo) | Ask the user to run `python3 scripts/setup_auth.py` (browser sign-in). No refresh flow exists |
| 404 | Resource removed from catalog | Skip, log warning, continue |
| 429 | Rate limited | Exponential backoff: 1s→2s→4s→8s, max 3 retries |
| Empty data | New user or privacy settings | Fall back: Replay → recs → manual seeds |

## Presenting Results

After creating a playlist:
1. ✅ Confirmation with playlist name
2. Brief explanation connecting the curation to their taste
3. Track listing (# · Song · Artist)
4. Offer refinement: "Want me to adjust the energy, swap tracks, or make it longer?"

**Tone:** Music-savvy friend. Be specific about why tracks were chosen.
Say "I noticed you've been deep into shoegaze lately, so I pulled Slowdive deep cuts and
some bands in that orbit" — not "Here's an awesome playlist just for you!"

## Reference Files

| File | Read when... |
|---|---|
| `references/auth-setup.md` | User needs token setup help (start with `setup_auth.py`) |
| `references/api-reference.md` | Need endpoint details, formats, genre IDs |
| `references/playlist-strategies.md` | Before executing any playlist strategy |
| `references/troubleshooting.md` | User hits errors, things aren't working |
| `references/spotify-import.md` | User wants to move a Spotify playlist to Apple Music |

## Privacy & Data Disclosure

This skill accesses user data through the Apple Music API. Here's exactly what it reads,
stores, and transmits.

**Data read (via Apple Music API):**

| Data | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Recently played tracks | `/v1/me/recent/played/tracks` | Current taste signal |
| Recently played albums, playlists, stations | `/v1/me/recent/played` | Same signal; only the `apple_music_api.sh recent-played` command reads it |
| Heavy rotation | `/v1/me/history/heavy-rotation` | Repeated listening signal |
| Library songs & artists | `/v1/me/library/songs`, `/v1/me/library/artists` | Broad taste mapping |
| Ratings (loved/disliked) | `/v1/me/ratings/songs` | Explicit preferences |
| Ratings of albums, playlists, music videos | `/v1/me/ratings/{type}` | Read only, via `apple_music_api.sh ratings <type>` |
| Recommendations | `/v1/me/recommendations` | Apple's inference data |
| Replay summaries | `/v1/me/music-summaries` | Annual listening stats |
| Replay milestones | `/v1/me/music-summaries/milestones` | Listening milestones for the year-in-review |
| Recently added | `/v1/me/library/recently-added` | What the user is into right now |
| Recent radio stations | `/v1/me/recent/radio-stations` | Light genre signal from station titles |
| Storefront | `/v1/me/storefront` | Region detection |

**Requirements.** Always needed: `curl`, `jq`, `python3` (3.10+). Needed for your own music (not for
the demo): `APPLE_MUSIC_DEV_TOKEN`, `APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN` — declared under `envVars` with
`required: false` so the skill stays loadable before setup, and checked by each script at run time. Optional, each used by one feature only: `APPLE_MUSIC_STOREFRONT` (override region
detection); `crontab` (scheduling); and for generating a developer token yourself with
`setup_auth.py` or `generate_dev_token.py`, `APPLE_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (your MusicKit
`.p8` signing key, read only by that script and never sent anywhere) plus the `PyJWT` and
`cryptography` packages. **License:** MIT (see `LICENSE`); ClawHub distributes published skills
under MIT-0.

**Data written to the user's account (only on request — always confirm first):**

| Action | Endpoint | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|
| Create playlist / add tracks | `/v1/me/library/playlists` | `--create`, playlist import |
| Add albums to library | `/v1/me/library` | gap analysis `--add-missing N --yes` |
| Add to favorites | `/v1/me/favorites` | `--create --favorite` |
| Add / remove tracks in an existing playlist | `/v1/me/library/playlists/{id}/tracks` | `playlist_health.py fix --apply`, `build_playlist.sh refresh` / `remove` |
| Rate / un-rate a song | `/v1/me/ratings/songs/{id}` | `feedback.py like/dislike/clear` |

**Data stored locally:**

| File | Contents | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Taste profile cache | Aggregated taste data (JSON) | `~/.apple-music-dj/taste_profile.json` |
| Taste snapshots | Genre/artist/era weights, no song IDs (last 52, one per day) | `~/.apple-music-dj/snapshots/` |
| Cron job logs | Output of scheduled jobs (playlist names, picks) — only if cron is installed | `~/.apple-music-dj/logs/` (files `0600`) |
| Playlist history | Names and track IDs of playlists the DJ created | `~/.apple-music-dj/playlist_history.json` |
| Storefront cache | Your two-letter region code (e.g. `us`) | `~/.apple-music-dj/storefront.cache` |
| User config (optional) | Defaults you write yourself; the skill only reads it | `~/.apple-music-dj/config.json` |
| Taste DNA Card | Generated SVG image | User-specified output path |
| User-token age record | A 16-hex-digit SHA-256 fingerprint of the user token (not the token) and the date it was first seen, for the renewal reminder | `~/.apple-music-dj/user_token_seen.json` |
| Token env file | The two `export` lines — only if the user passes `setup_auth.py --env-file PATH` | `PATH` (mode `0600`) |
| Demo data | The fictional demo listener's profile and snapshots | `~/.apple-music-dj-demo/` (`demo.py reset` removes it) |

**Data NOT collected:**
- No data is sent to any third-party service
- No analytics or telemetry
- The only destination is Apple: requests go directly to `https://api.music.apple.com` (and, during
  `setup_auth.py`, MusicKit JS from Apple's CDN), and nothing is sent to anyone else
- Tokens are never logged, and never stored unless the user asks (`setup_auth.py --env-file`)
- To keep tokens off the process list, the API wrapper and `verify_setup.sh` hand them to `curl` through
  a temporary owner-only (`0600`) config file that is deleted on exit, Ctrl-C and `kill`
- `setup_auth.py` serves its sign-in page on `127.0.0.1` only, behind a random one-time URL, and
  stops as soon as the token arrives; the page loads Apple's MusicKit JS from Apple's CDN
- `demo.py` runs its sample API on `127.0.0.1` only for the length of one command, strips real
  Apple credentials from the scripts it runs, and refuses `setup_cron.py` and paths into `~/.apple-music-dj/`

**Cache management:**
- Taste profile cache has a 7-day TTL by default
- The user can clear it by deleting the `~/.apple-music-dj/` folder (list it first with
  `ls -la ~/.apple-music-dj`; it holds their profile, snapshots, history and cron logs). Never delete
  it on your own initiative.
- Use `--max-age 0` to bypass cache and fetch fresh data
