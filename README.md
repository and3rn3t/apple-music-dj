**Your AI-powered Apple Music curator.** Analyzes your listening history, understands your taste DNA, and creates intelligent playlists directly in your Apple Music library — on all your devices.

An [Agent Skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai)) and [Claude Code](#use-with-claude-code). Talk naturally, get playlists.

**Read-only by default.** Nothing changes in your Apple Music account until you approve it — [see exactly what it can change](#-what-it-can-change).

**No Apple Developer account yet?** Try it in 30 seconds with the built-in demo: [`python3 scripts/demo.py tour`](#-try-it-first-no-account-needed).

## ✨ Features

- **🧬 Taste DNA Profiling** — Deep analysis of your listening from recently played, heavy rotation, library, ratings, recommendations, and Apple Music Replay
- **🧪 Demo mode** — Try every feature against a fictional listener, no tokens needed
- **🔑 One-step setup** — `setup_auth.py` signs your developer token and gets your user token from a browser sign-in
- **🔗 Taste codes** — Send a friend one short line and blend your tastes, no files to swap
- **🎵 8 Playlist Strategies** — Deep cuts, mood/activity, trend radar, constellation discovery, playlist refresh, **songs-like-X seed**, **decade throwbacks**, and **two-person blends**
- **🌊 Energy-arc sequencing** — Playlists build, peak and wind down (or rise/fall for workouts and sleep) instead of just spacing artists out
- **📈 Taste Drift** — Dated snapshots show how your genres, artists and listener archetype change over time
- **📥 Playlist Import** — Rebuild a Spotify (CSV) or plain-text playlist in Apple Music, matched by ISRC when the export has it, otherwise by title + artist

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Apple Developer Account** | [$99/year](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) — needed for MusicKit API access (not for the demo) |
| **Apple Music subscription** | Active subscription on your Apple ID (not for the demo) |
| **Python** | 3.11+ (no pip packages needed for core features; `PyJWT` + `cryptography` only to sign a developer token) |
| **Skill host** | [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai)) or [Claude Code](#use-with-claude-code) |
| **OS** | macOS or Linux (CI runs the scripts on both) |
| **CLI tools** | `curl`, `jq` (usually pre-installed on macOS) |

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
# From ClawHub (recommended)
openclaw skills install apple-music-dj

# Or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/and3rn3t/apple-music-dj.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/apple-music-dj
```

Start a new OpenClaw session afterwards so the skill loads. It loads even before you've set up
any tokens, so you can ask it for the demo first; anything that reads your own music asks for the
tokens when it needs them.

### Use with Claude Code

It's a standard Agent Skill, so Claude Code can load it too:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/and3rn3t/apple-music-dj.git ~/.claude/skills/apple-music-dj
```

Start a new Claude Code session and ask *"Show me what the Apple Music DJ can do."* For your own
music, put the two token `export` lines from [setup](#1-get-your-tokens-one-command) in your shell
profile so the scripts can read them.

## 🧪 Try it first (no account needed)

```bash
python3 scripts/demo.py tour
```

Runs the real scripts against a fictional listener and a small sample catalog served on `127.0.0.1`:
a Taste DNA card, a "songs like Radiohead" playlist, a 90s throwback, a daily pick and a
compatibility score. Nothing is sent to Apple and nothing touches an account. Any script works the
same way, with `DEMO_PROFILE` standing in for the profile:

```bash
python3 scripts/demo.py run strategy_engine.py --strategy mood --mood focus --profile DEMO_PROFILE
```

Or just ask OpenClaw: *"Show me what the Apple Music DJ can do."*

## 🔁 Moving from Spotify?

Bring your playlists with you. Export one as a CSV (or just paste `Artist - Title` lines into a text
file) and preview the match before anything is created:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_playlist.py my-playlist.csv                          # preview, writes nothing
python3 scripts/import_playlist.py my-playlist.csv --create --name "From Spotify"
```

Tracks are matched by ISRC when your export has it, otherwise by a strict title + artist search;
anything unclear is listed as unmatched, never guessed. Try it with no account on the included
sample: `python3 scripts/demo.py run import_playlist.py assets/sample-spotify-export.csv --storefront us`.
Step-by-step: [`references/spotify-import.md`](references/spotify-import.md).

## ⚡ 5 Minutes to First Playlist

### 1. Get your tokens (one command)

You need an Apple Developer account and a MusicKit key (`.p8`) — [`references/auth-setup.md`](references/auth-setup.md)
shows where to click. Then:

```bash
pip install PyJWT cryptography          # only needed to sign the developer token
python3 scripts/setup_auth.py --key-id ABC123DEFG --team-id XYZ987TEAM --key-path ~/AuthKey_ABC123DEFG.p8
```

It signs your developer token, opens a local page where you sign in with Apple, and prints the two
`export` lines (or writes them to an owner-only file with `--env-file`). Add them to your shell
profile, or to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `skills.entries."apple-music-dj".env`.

Tokens last about 6 months. `python3 scripts/setup_auth.py status` shows how long you have, and
the skill warns you two weeks ahead.

### 2. Verify setup

```bash
scripts/verify_setup.sh
```

### 3. Talk to your DJ

Open OpenClaw and say:

> "Analyze my Apple Music taste and make me a playlist"

That's it. Your taste profile is built, a playlist is generated, and it appears in Apple Music.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    you([You ask]) --> profile["Taste profile<br/>from your listening"]
    profile --> strategy["Strategy picks and<br/>sequences tracks"]
    strategy --> preview["Preview in chat"]
    preview -->|you approve| playlist([Playlist in Apple Music])
```

More detail in [`references/architecture.md`](references/architecture.md).

## 🔒 What it can change

Read-only by default. Every write to your account is opt-in and previewed first:

| Action | Needs | When |
|---|---|---|
| Read listening history, library, ratings | Your tokens | Every profile build |
| Create a playlist | `--create` | After you approve the preview |
| Add or remove tracks in an existing playlist | `--apply` / `--yes` | After you see the exact changes |
| Add albums to your library | `--add-missing N --yes` | Gap analysis, on request |
| Favorite / rate songs | `--favorite`, `feedback.py … --yes` | Only when you say so |
| Scheduled jobs | `setup_cron.py install --confirm <digest>` | Report-only by default; `weekly-mix` is opt-in |

Data stays on your machine in `~/.apple-music-dj/` (owner-only). Full details: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
and the privacy section of [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md).

## 🔗 Blend with a friend

No files to swap. Each of you runs one command, sends the other a short code, and either of you
makes the blend:

```bash
python3 scripts/share_code.py make                 # prints your code, e.g. amdj1:eNpV0E0K…
python3 scripts/share_code.py show amdj1:eNpV0E0K…   # see exactly what a code contains
python3 scripts/strategy_engine.py --strategy blend --profile ~/.apple-music-dj/taste_profile.json \
        --profile-b amdj1:eNpV0E0K… --storefront us
```

A code holds only artist names, genre and decade weights and a few scores: no song IDs, ratings,
library or tokens, and nothing is uploaded. Codes from other people are size-capped, validated and
cleaned before use. A blend from a code can't use their loved tracks or dislikes, so it leans on
shared artists and the genres you have in common.

### "Songs like Radiohead"

`strategy_engine.py --strategy similar --similar-to "Radiohead"` picks the artist's best songs plus
similar artists' top songs, then scores them against your own taste:

```
Like Radiohead · Oct 2026
 1. Starlight — Muse                   Fans of Radiohead tend to love Muse.
 2. Champagne Supernova — Oasis        Fans of Radiohead tend to love Oasis.
 3. Paranoid Android — Radiohead       One of Radiohead's best.
 4. Wonderwall — Oasis                 Fans of Radiohead tend to love Oasis.
 5. Supermassive Black Hole — Muse     Fans of Radiohead tend to love Muse.
```

### How has your taste changed?

Every fresh profile build saves a small dated snapshot; `taste_drift.py` compares two of them:

```
Taste drift: 2026-07-12 → 2026-10-11 (91 days)

Your taste moved toward Electronic (+10%) and away from Alternative (−7%). Khruangbin and 1 more
entered your top 20. You've gone from a Genre Drifter to a Deep Catalog Digger.

Rising:   Electronic +10%, Ambient +2%
Falling:  Alternative −7%, Singer/Songwriter −7%, Indie −3%
New top artists:     Khruangbin, Boards of Canada
Fell out of top 20:  Big Thief, Bon Iver
```

## 🔒 Privacy

All data stays on your machine. The skill reads your Apple Music listening data via the official API and caches it locally at `~/.apple-music-dj/`. Nothing is sent to third-party services. Tokens are read from environment variables and never logged; they are only written to disk if you ask `setup_auth.py --env-file` to (mode 600). For the renewal reminder the skill keeps a short fingerprint of the user token — never the token — and the date it first saw it. Taste drift keeps small dated snapshots (genre/artist/era weights, no song IDs) in `~/.apple-music-dj/snapshots/`. The skill only writes to your Apple Music account when you ask — creating playlists, adding missing albums, favoriting tracks, or rating songs — and the account-changing options (`--add-missing`, `--favorite`, feedback) are explicit.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
make test              # Run all tests
make coverage          # Tests with coverage summary (fails below 90%)
make coverage-html     # Generate HTML coverage report
```

1,100+ tests across 27 modules — 92% coverage. Covers taste profiling, archetype detection, compatibility scoring, card generation, all eight strategies and energy-arc sequencing, taste drift, playlist import, feedback, playlist health, history tracking, cron setup, token generation and guided setup, demo mode, end-to-end runs against a local mock API, and shared utilities.
