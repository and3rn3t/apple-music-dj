GET /v1/me/ratings/albums?limit=100
```
Returns items with `value`: 1 (loved) or -1 (disliked).

```

### Recommendations

```
Returns recommendation groups containing albums, playlists, stations.

### Replay / Music Summaries
```
GET /v1/me/music-summaries
GET /v1/me/music-summaries?filter[year]=2025
GET /v1/me/music-summaries/milestones
GET /v1/me/music-summaries/milestones?filter[year]=2025
```
Annual listening stats: top artists, albums, songs, listen time, milestones.
Not available for all users/regions.

### User Storefront
```
GET /v1/me/storefront
```
Returns the user's storefront (country code). Use to auto-detect locale.

### Create Playlist
```
POST /v1/me/library/playlists
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "name": "Playlist Name",
    "description": "Optional description"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "tracks": {
      "data": [
        {"id": "CATALOG_SONG_ID", "type": "songs"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Use **catalog** song IDs (not library IDs). Returns 201.

### Add Tracks to Playlist
```
POST /v1/me/library/playlists/{id}/tracks
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{"data": [{"id": "CATALOG_SONG_ID", "type": "songs"}]}
```

### Get Playlist Tracks
```
GET /v1/me/library/playlists/{id}/tracks?limit=100
```

### Recently Added
```
GET /v1/me/library/recently-added?limit=25
```
Albums and playlists recently added to the library. Albums carry `artistName` and
`genreNames`; playlists don't, so the profiler skips them. Used as a "what I'm into now" signal.

### Recent Radio Stations
```
GET /v1/me/recent/radio-stations?limit=10
```
Station resources have no genre attribute, so the profiler only picks up genres that appear
in the station *title* (e.g. "Alternative Radio") and treats them as a very light signal.

### Add Albums / Songs to Library
```
POST /v1/me/library?ids[albums]=ID1,ID2      (or ids[songs]=...)
```
No request body; answers `202` with an empty body (not JSON — call `call_api(..., raw=True)`).
Wrapper: `apple_music_api.sh add-to-library <albums|songs> <ids>`. **Writes to the account.**

### Add to Favorites
```
POST /v1/me/favorites?ids[songs]=ID1,ID2     (also albums, artists, playlists)
```
Empty-body response. Wrapper: `apple_music_api.sh favorite <type> <ids>`. **Writes to the account.**
Apple documents only this write endpoint — there is no documented way to *read* favorites,
so the profiler keeps using ratings (loved/disliked) as its explicit-preference signal.

### Rate a Song
```
PUT    /v1/me/ratings/songs/{id}     body: {"type":"rating","attributes":{"value":1}}   (1 = love, -1 = dislike)
DELETE /v1/me/ratings/songs/{id}
```
Wrappers: `apple_music_api.sh rate <id> <1|-1>` and `unrate <id>`. **Writes to the account.**

GET /v1/catalog/{storefront}/search?term=query&types=songs,artists,albums&limit=25
```

### Charts

```

```

### Similar Artists
```
GET /v1/catalog/{storefront}/artists/{id}/view/similar-artists?limit=20
```
Wrapper: `apple_music_api.sh similar-artists <storefront> <artist_id>`.

### Songs by ISRC
```
GET /v1/catalog/{storefront}/songs?filter[isrc]=ISRC1,ISRC2
```
Max 25 ISRCs per request. Each song's `attributes.isrc` identifies which input it matched; one ISRC
can return several catalog songs (different albums), so importers take the first.
Wrapper: `apple_music_api.sh songs-by-isrc <storefront> <isrcs>`.
